# Ransomware – Detailed Notes

---

## 1. Introduction
- **Definition**:  
  Ransomware is a type of **malicious software** (malware) that:
  - Infiltrates servers, computers, and networks.
  - Encrypts valuable files, making them **inaccessible**.
  - Demands a **ransom payment** (often in cryptocurrency like Bitcoin) in exchange for a **decryption key**.
- Analogy:  
  Like a **digital hostage situation** — your files are locked until you pay.

## 2. Purpose
- **Primary Goal**: Financial gain for attackers.
- **Targets**:
  - Individuals
  - Businesses
  - Hospitals
  - Governments
- **Impact Beyond Money**:
  - Disrupt essential services.
  - Erode trust and damage reputations.
  - In critical sectors (e.g., healthcare), may **endanger lives**.

## 3. Real-World Analogy
- Imagine you own a small art gallery with priceless works.
- You arrive one morning to find:
  - All artwork locked in impenetrable glass cases.
  - A ransom note demanding payment for the keys.
- Until you pay, your gallery can’t function.
- This mirrors how ransomware locks digital assets until payment is made.

## 4. How Ransomware Works
### Example – WannaCry Attack (May 2017)
- **Scale**:
  - Affected over **200,000 computers** in 150+ countries.
  - Hit UK’s National Health Service (NHS) particularly hard.
  - Canceled surgeries, diverted ambulances, and blocked patient records.
- **Ransom Demand**: $300–$600 in Bitcoin.
- **Vulnerability Exploited**: Unpatched Microsoft Windows systems.

### Typical Stages of a Ransomware Attack:
1. **Initial Access**:
   - Often via **phishing emails** disguised as trusted sources.
   - Contain malicious links or attachments.
2. **Execution**:
   - Ransomware is installed when the victim clicks the link or opens the file.
3. **Encryption**:
   - Files (documents, photos, databases) scrambled using complex algorithms.
   - Data becomes unreadable without the decryption key.
4. **Ransom Demand**:
   - Message displayed with payment instructions and a deadline.
5. **Outcome**:
   - No guarantee the attacker will provide a working decryption key.
   - Paying may make the victim a **future target**.

## 5. Impact of Ransomware
- **Operational Disruption**:
  - Services shut down; businesses grind to a halt.
  - In healthcare: inability to access patient data or schedule treatments.
- **Financial Losses**:
  - Ransom payments.
  - Downtime costs.
  - Recovery and security upgrades.
- **Data Loss**:
  - Permanent loss if backups are unavailable or compromised.
- **Reputation Damage**:
  - Erodes customer trust.
  - Can lead to long-term revenue decline.
- **Cycle of Crime**:
  - Paying ransoms encourages attackers to continue.

## 6. Additional Analogy
- A public library finds all its books locked in coded cases.
- A ransom note demands payment for the unlock codes.
- Until paid:
  - No borrowing, studying, or research is possible.
  - Impacts not just the library but all who depend on it.

---

## 7. Conclusion
- **Ransomware = Advanced, targeted cyber extortion.**
- Impacts victims and everyone dependent on them.
- Global cybercrime costs are projected to reach **trillions of dollars annually by 2025** (Cybersecurity Ventures).
