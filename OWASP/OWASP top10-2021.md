# ðŸ”‘ Broken Access Control (BAC)

## ðŸ“Œ What is Access Control?
Access control ensures **who** (user, role, identity) can perform **what** (action, resource access) in a system.  
- **Authentication** â†’ Verifies identity (login).  
- **Authorization** â†’ Determines allowed actions.  

**Broken Access Control (BAC)** = Failure to properly enforce authorization rules, letting attackers do things they shouldnâ€™t.

---

## ðŸš¨ Examples of Broken Access Control
1. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**  
   - Example:  
     ```
     https://bank.com/account?id=123   â†’ your account
     https://bank.com/account?id=124   â†’ another userâ€™s account
     ```

2. **Privilege Escalation**  
   - Normal user becomes **admin** by changing a cookie/token.  

3. **Force Browsing**  
   - Accessing restricted pages by guessing URLs (`/admin`, `/deleteUser`).  

4. **Bypassing Access Controls**  
   - Directly calling API endpoints without proper role checks.  

5. **CORS Misconfigurations**  
   - Allowing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` exposes sensitive APIs.

## ðŸ›  Attack Techniques
- URL/parameter manipulation (`id=101 â†’ id=102`)  
- Cookie/JWT tampering (`role=user â†’ role=admin`)  
- Modifying hidden form fields  
- Brute-forcing IDs or URLs  
- Direct API calls not exposed in the UI

## ðŸ”’ How to Prevent Broken Access Control
âœ” **Deny by default** â€“ Block all unless explicitly allowed.  
âœ” **Enforce access control server-side** â€“ Never trust the client.  
âœ” **Role-Based / Attribute-Based Access Control** â€“ Admins vs users.  
âœ” **Use indirect references** â€“ Replace sequential IDs with UUIDs.  
âœ” **Audit & Pen-test** â€“ Use tools like **Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP**.  

---

## ðŸ§  Real-World Examples
- **Facebook (2018):** IDOR allowed access to private posts.  
- **E-commerce sites:** Attackers changing order IDs to view othersâ€™ invoices.  

---

## âœ… Summary
- Broken Access Control = **most critical OWASP Top 10 risk**.  
- Attackers exploit weak/missing authorization checks.  
- Impacts: **data exposure, privilege escalation, full system compromise**.
