# Purple Team — Deep Guide

> **Purpose (short):** combine Red (offense) and Blue (defense) strengths into continuous, measurable security improvement by running joint exercises, building detections, and closing remediation loops.

---    

## Quick overview & philosophy
Purple Teaming is not just “Red tells Blue what it did.” It’s a goal-driven collaboration loop:
1. **Plan** an exercise with measurable objectives.
2. **Execute** adversary emulation (Red) while Blue defends and observes.
3. **Capture telemetry** and test detection content (rules, hunts, alerts).
4. **Triage & iterate** — tune detections, update playbooks, remediate root causes.
5. Repeat with expanding scope and more realistic adversary behaviors.

Effective Purple Teams create reproducible test cases, detection tests, and a prioritized remediation queue — they close the loop so that lessons lead to permanent improvements.

## Composition & roles
A Purple Team is a mix of Red, Blue, and supporting roles. Typical roles and responsibilities:

- **Purple Lead / Program Owner**  
  Coordinates exercises, sets objectives & metrics, communicates with stakeholders.
- **Red Team / Adversary Emulation**  
  Pen testers, threat emulators who craft attack chains, payloads, timelines.
- **Blue Team / Defenders**  
  SOC analysts, IR, detection engineers working live to detect and respond.
- **Detection Engineer**  
  Builds rules, hunts, analytics, pipelines and automated tests.
- **Telemetry / Logging Engineer**  
  Ensures data sources, parsers, enrichment (threat intel, asset tags) are available.
- **Cloud/Platform Engineers**  
  Installs agents, configures logging, implements compensating controls.
- **Business Stakeholders / Risk Owners**  
  Provide scope, accept risk, ensure remediation gets funded and tracked.

## Operating models (choose one or combine)
- **Embedded model** — Red and Blue members embedded into a single permanent Purple unit.  
  Pros: continuous collaboration; Cons: cost.
- **Advisory model** — dedicated Red and Blue teams collaborate for scheduled engagements; Purple lead coordinates.  
  Pros: flexible; Cons: slower feedback loops.
- **Tool-driven model** — automation platforms coordinate Red/Blue test cases and detection validation.  
  Pros: repeatability; Cons: high initial setup.

## Exercise design
1. **Define threat actor or attack scenario** (based on threat intel).  
2. **Map to MITRE ATT&CK** techniques for coverage tracking.  
3. **Outline timeline** (execution windows, pauses for Blue to react).  
4. **Set success criteria** (detections triggered, response time, gaps found).  
5. **Run exercise live** with structured observation and logging.

## Telemetry & detection engineering
- Log sources to validate: EDR, network IDS, firewall, DNS logs, cloud audit logs.  
- Ensure log parsing and enrichment (geoIP, process lineage, parent/child process IDs).  
- Create Sigma/YARA/EDR rules based on Red Team actions.  
- Deploy automated detection-as-code pipelines for regression testing.

## Sample scenarios
- **Initial access:** Phishing + malicious document dropper.  
- **Execution:** PowerShell Empire stager.  
- **Persistence:** Registry Run key + scheduled task.  
- **Lateral movement:** Pass-the-Hash with Mimikatz.  
- **Exfiltration:** Compressed data over HTTPS to external server.

---

## Metrics & KPIs
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)  
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)  
- % MITRE ATT&CK coverage  
- Detection fidelity (true positive rate)  
- Remediation closure rate  
- Exercise-to-remediation lead time  

---

## Pitfalls to avoid
- Treating Purple Teaming as one-off events.  
- Poor logging pipelines — detection tuning without telemetry is futile.  
- No buy-in from leadership → remediation never implemented.  
- Red and Blue rivalry culture — undermines collaboration.

## 30/60/90 day starter plan
**30 days:** Identify stakeholders, pick tooling, run small scoped scenario.  
**60 days:** Expand scope, begin detection-as-code, track metrics.  
**90 days:** Full-cycle program with continuous testing, metrics reporting, and remediation tracking.
