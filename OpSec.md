# Operational Security (OpSec) Notes

Operational Security (OpSec) is a critical component of an organization's overall security strategy. It encompasses processes and practices for safeguarding data assets throughout their lifecycle, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## 🔐 Analogy: OpSec as a House Party

Imagine planning a birthday party at home:
- You have valuable items (e.g., game console, heirloom) you want to protect.
- OpSec is like the plan you use to keep these valuables safe while hosting the party.

## 📌 Key Steps in Operational Security

### 1. Asset Identification
- Determine what needs protection.
- These are critical information assets (e.g., databases, customer info, proprietary code).

### 2. Threat Identification
- Identify potential threats (accidents, intrusions, misconfigurations).
- Assess who or what could harm your assets (e.g., hackers, insiders, careless users).

### 3. Vulnerability Identification
- Find weak spots in your security posture.
- Apply measures such as:
  - Password protection
  - Physical barriers
  - Surveillance systems

### 4. Access Control
- Decide who gets access to what.
- Implement:
  - Role-based access control
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  - Least privilege principles
  - Regular access audits

### 5. Monitoring
- Continuously observe for anomalies or policy violations.
- Adjust security measures in response to changes or threats.

## 🧰 Core Components of OpSec

### 🔑 Access Control
- Controls who can access information and systems.
- Includes:
  - Authentication (e.g., MFA)
  - Authorization
  - Access reviews and audits

### 🖥️ Asset Management
- Maintain an updated inventory of:
  - Hardware
  - Software
  - Data assets
- Understand location and importance of each asset to prioritize protections.

### 🔁 Change Management
- Ensure changes to systems and processes are:
  - Controlled
  - Approved
  - Tested
- Prevent the introduction of new vulnerabilities.

### 🎓 Security Awareness Training
- Educate staff on:
  - Phishing and social engineering
  - Strong password practices
  - Safe handling of sensitive information

## 🧑‍💼 OpSec Responsibility

- **Primary Responsibility**: Information Security Team, led by the **CISO** (Chief Information Security Officer).
- Collaborates with: IT, HR, Legal, and Business Units.
- **All employees** play a role in maintaining OpSec—security is everyone's responsibility.

---

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

- Performed by:
  - Internal security teams
  - External consultants (e.g., penetration testers)
- Techniques include:
  - Bypassing access controls
  - Exploiting misconfigurations
  - Social engineering
- Purpose: identify weaknesses before attackers do.

## 🌐 Network Environment (Illustrative)

A network diagram typically includes:
- **Applications**
- **Servers**
- **Cloud infrastructure**
- **Internet**
- **Client connections**
- **Employees (mobile & desktop)**
- **Company Teams**:
  - **Blue Team** (Defense)
  - **Red Team** (Offense/Testing)
  - **Purple Team** (Collaboration of Blue & Red)

## 🔁 Summary

OpSec is:
- **Proactive & Continuous**
- Focused on:
  - Identifying and protecting critical data
  - Assessing threats and vulnerabilities
  - Controlling access
  - Monitoring and adapting to change

A strong OpSec posture enables secure day-to-day operations and protects an organization from internal and external threats.
