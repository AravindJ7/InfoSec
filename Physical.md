# Physical Security

## Introduction
Physical security involves protecting actual hardware and facilities that store and process data, such as:
- Computers
- Servers
- Network equipment
- Printed documents

The goal is to prevent unauthorized access to these resources, reducing risks of data breaches, theft, or damage.

## Analogy: Candy Store Example
Imagine owning a candy store filled with treats. You secure:
- Cash register
- Candy displays

But without proper locks, alarms, or guards, intruders could steal everything after hours.  
Physical security works the same way for protecting sensitive data.

## Elements of Physical Security
Physical security is more than just locks and guards â€” it integrates **people, processes, and technology**.

### Examples:
- Architectural design considerations
- Access control systems
- Surveillance (CCTV)
- Environmental controls
- Personnel security practices

### Defense in Depth
A layered approach to **deter, detect, delay, and respond** to threats:
1. **Deter:** Fencing, warning signs
2. **Detect:** Sensors, alarms
3. **Delay:** Reinforced doors, barriers
4. **Respond:** On-site security, police

## Importance of Physical Security
- Protects valuable assets (equipment, data)
- Safeguards personnel
- Maintains operational continuity
- Ensures regulatory compliance

---

## Responsibility
- **Physical Security Team:** Implements and manages security systems
- **Facilities Management:** Maintains building and systems
- **IT Security Team:** Secures hardware and works with physical security teams
- **All Employees:** Follow security protocols

---

## Testing Physical Security
Specialized professionals (e.g., **Red Teamers**) simulate attacks to find vulnerabilities.

### Common Vulnerabilities
| Vulnerability             | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Unsecured access points   | Doors, windows left unlocked or easily bypassed |
| Weak locks                | Outdated/low-quality locks |
| Inadequate perimeter security | Lack of fencing/barriers/surveillance |
| Poor key management       | Improper handling of keys or access cards |
| Insufficient lighting     | Dark areas that hide intruders |
| Exposed IT infrastructure | Servers or network devices accessible to unauthorized people |
| Lack of visitor management| Weak identification and escort policies |
| Unattended workstations   | Computers left unlocked in public spaces |

## Relevance to Information Security
- Protects **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of data
- Cybersecurity alone cannot protect against physical breaches
- Must be part of a **comprehensive InfoSec strategy**
